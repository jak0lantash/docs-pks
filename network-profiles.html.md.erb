title: Using and Managing Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)
owner: TKGI

This topic describes how to use network profiles for Kubernetes clusters
provisioned with <%= vars.product_full %> on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

Network profiles let you customize NSX-T configuration parameters.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisite

To use or manage a network profile, you must be a cluster manager, `pks.clusters.manage`.  

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

<%= vars.product_short %> cluster managers can manage network profiles and apply network profiles to clusters:

* [List Network Profiles](#list-profiles)
* [Create a Cluster with a Network Profile](#create-new)
* [Assign a Network Profile to an Existing Cluster](#assign-profile)
* [Update an Existing Network Profile](#update-profile)

<%= vars.product_short %> cluster administrators with the `pks.clusters.admin` role can create and delete network profiles. 
For more information on how cluster administrators create and delete network profiles, see [Creating and Administering Network Profiles](./network-profiles-define.html).  

For information on when to use network profiles, see [Network Profile Use Cases](#use-cases) below.  

## <a id="list-profiles"></a> List Network Profiles

To list available network profiles:  

1. Run the following command:  

    ```
    tkgi network-profiles
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ tkgi network-profiles

	Name				Description 
	lb-profile-medium	Network profile for medium size NSX-T load balancer
	small-routable-pod 	Network profile with small load balancer and two routable pod networks
    </pre>

## <a id='create-new'></a> Create a Cluster with a Network Profile

You can assign a network profile to an <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster at the time of cluster creation.

To create a Kubernetes cluster with a network profile:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    tkgi create-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --external-hostname HOSTNAME --plan PLAN-NAME --network-profile NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is a unique name for your cluster.
    * `HOSTNAME` is your external hostname used for accessing the Kubernetes API.
    * `PLAN-NAME` is the name of the <%= vars.product_short %> plan you want to use for your cluster.
    * `NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the network profile you want to use for your cluster.

## <a id="assign-profile"></a> Assign a Network Profile to an Existing Cluster
 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports assigning network profile to an existing cluster.
You can use the following procedure to assign a network profile to a cluster that does not have a network profile already applied.

1. Do one of the following
	- Choose a new network profile for the cluster.
	See [List Network Profiles](#list-profiles).
	- Have a <%= vars.product_short %> cluster administrator define and create a new network profile as described in [Create a Network Profile](./network-profiles.html#create-profile) in _Creating and Managing Network Profiles_. 
  		- The name of the new network profile must be unique and different from the previously assigned network profile.

1. Run the following command to apply the network profile to the cluster:

    ```
    tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --network-profile NEW-NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME
    ```

    Where: 
    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the existing Kubernetes cluster 
    * `NEW-NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the new network profile you want to apply to the cluster.

## <a id="update-profile"></a> Update an Existing Network Profile

The use cases for updating an existing network profile are limited to adding to or changing the order of Pod IP Blocks. See [Customize Pod Networks](./network-profiles-pods.html) for details.

In terms of changing a network profile, there are strict network profile update validation rules governing the `tkgi update-cluster --network-profile` command applied against a cluster with an existing network profile:

- If a field in the original network profile is empty, the system ignores the empty field even if the field is included in the new network profile. 
- If the existing `pod_ip_block_ids` field contains the same entries as the new network profile, the `update-cluster --network-profile` operation passes validation. 
- If a field in the existing network profile conflicts with a field in the new network profile, the system reports the conflict and fails the validation.
- If the field is empty in the new network profile, then the system ignores the field even if the field is not empty in the original network profile.

## <a id='use-cases'></a> Network Profile Use Cases

Network profiles let you customize configuration parameters for 
Kubernetes clusters provisioned by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with NSX&#8209;T.  

You can apply a network profile to a Kubernetes cluster for the following scenarios:
