This topic describes how to rotate certificates for
Kubernetes clusters created by <%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview of Rotating Cluster Certificates

Certificate authority (CA) certificates used by
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-created Kubernetes clusters
and the leaf-level certificates that they issue include the following:

* **Cluster-specific certificates:** Kubernetes cluster certificates that have values and 
expiration dates unique to each cluster.  
<br>
    The following table lists the cluster-specific certificates and how to rotate them.

    <table id='cluster-certs' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th>Certificates</th>
    <th>When Used</th>
    <th>How to Rotate</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>kubo_ca_2018</code>, <code>etcd_ca_2018</code>, and their leaf certificates</td>
    <td>All clusters.</td>
    <td>See <a href="#unique">Rotate Cluster-Specific Certificates</a> below.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>tls_nsx_t</code> and <code>tls_nsx_lb</code></td>
    <td>NSX-T only. These certificates must be registered with NSX Manager.</td>
    <td>See <a href="rotate-cluster-certificates.html#unique-nsxt">Rotate Cluster-Specific NSX-T Certificates</a>.
  </tr>
    </table>
<br>
* **Shared cluster certificates:** Certificates that are common to all 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-deployed Kubernetes clusters. 
Shared cluster certificates do not have unique values for each cluster.
Some of them are used by the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane
for communication between the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane and
the clusters.  
 <br>
    To rotate shared cluster certificates, see
    [Rotate Shared Cluster Certificates](#shared) below.  

<br>
For how to rotate certificates used only by the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane, and not Kubernetes clusters,
see [Rotating <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane Certificates](./rotate-tile-certificates.html).

## <a id="unique"></a>Rotate Cluster-Specific Certificates

This procedure rotates the following CA certificates and their leaf certificates:

-  `kubo_ca_2018`:
  - `tls-metrics-server-2018`
  - `tls-kubelet-client-2018`
  - `tls-kubelet-2018`
  - `tls-kube-controller-manager-2018`
- `etcd_ca_2018`:
  - `tls-etcdctl-root-2018-2`
  - `tls-etcdctl-flanneld-2018-2`
  - `tls-etcdctl-2018-2`
  - `tls-etcd-2018-2`

All <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-deployed Kubernetes clusters use `kubo_ca_2018`, `etcd_ca_2018`, and their leaf certificates.
Their values are unique to each cluster,
and their expiration dates depend on the cluster creation date.

The procedure below uses the CredHub Maestro command line interface (CLI) to rotate the
`kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates and their leaf certificates.


For more information about the CredHub Maestro CLI, see
[Getting Started with CredHub Maestro](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-9/security/pcf-infrastructure/getting-started-with-maestro-cli.html)
in the Ops Manager documentation.

**Limitations:**

  * In deployments that use NSX-T networking, clusters also have
unique NSX-T certificates that must be registered with the NSX Manager.
To rotate those, see [Rotate Cluster-Specific NSX-T Certificates](#unique-nsxt), below.
  * This procedure differs from the procedures to rotate shared cluster certificates
or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane certificates.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not use the instructions
in this section to rotate NSX-T certificates or shared Kubernetes cluster certificates.</p>


### <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

To rotate certificates using the CredHub Maestro CLI, you must have the following:

* <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9 or later.
Earlier versions of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> are not
compatible with the CredHub Maestro CLI.
* Kubernetes clusters upgraded to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.
* Ops Manager v2.9 or later.
* The `pks.cluster.admin` UAA scope.

The certificate rotation procedure
with the CredHub Maestro CLI provided below has been tested on
Ops Manager v2.9 and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.

### <a id="downtime"></a>Downtime

Depending on cluster topology, rotating `kubo_ca_2018` or `etcd_ca_2018` may cause cluster downtime while cluster nodes restart:

* **Multiple control plane (master) and worker nodes**: No downtime
* **Single control plane node**: Cluster control plane downtime
* **Single worker node**: Workload downtime

### <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Rotate

Before rotating your certificates, complete the following steps: 

1. [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify)
1. [Access CredHub Maestro on the Ops Manager VM](#access)
1. [Identify Your Cluster Deployment Names](#deployments)
1. [Determine Which Certificates Are Expiring](#deployment-expiration-dates)

#### <a id="identify"></a>Retrieve the Cluster UUID

This section describes how to retrieve the universally unique identifier (UUID)
of a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster.
You will use this UUID in [Identify Your Cluster Deployment Names](#deployments)
and [Rotate the Certificates](#rotate) below.

To retrieve the UUID of a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes
cluster:

1. Log in to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>. For instructions, see
[Logging in to <%= vars.product_short %>](login.html).
1. To view the list of your deployed clusters, run `tkgi clusters`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ tkgi clusters

    Name    Plan Name       UUID                                    Status       Action  
    test    multi-master    ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f    succeeded    CREATE
    </pre>   

1. In the output of the `tkgi clusters` command,
locate your target cluster and record its UUID. If you want to rotate the `kubo_ca_2018`
and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates and their leaf certificates for multiple clusters,
locate all your target clusters in the output and record the UUIDs.
1. Proceed to [Access CredHub Maestro on the Ops Manager VM](#access) below.

#### <a id="access"></a>Access CredHub Maestro on the Ops Manager VM

To access the CredHub Maestro CLI on the Ops Manager VM:

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM. For instructions, see
[Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-9/install/trouble-advanced.html#ssh)
in the Ops Manager documentation.
1. Set the BOSH command line and CredHub environment variables on the
Ops Manager VM.
    1. To set the BOSH environment variables,
    follow the instructions in
    [Set the BOSH Environment Variables on the Ops Manager VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-9/install/trouble-advanced.html#export-bosh-envs)
    in the Ops Manager documentation.

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ export BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager \
        BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=example_secret \
        BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
        BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.16.5 bosh
        </pre>

    1. To set the CredHub environment variables, export the following variables:
        * `CREDHUB_SERVER` is the URL of the BOSH Director CredHub server.
        This should be `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT:8844`.
        * `CREDHUB_CLIENT` is the name of the CredHub client.
        This is the same as `BOSH_CLIENT`.
        * `CREDHUB_SECRET` is the CredHub client secret.
        This is the same as `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
        * `CREDHUB_CA_CERT` is the path or value of the CredHub trusted CA certificate.
        This is the same as `BOSH_CA_CERT`.

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ export CREDHUB_SERVER=10.0.16.5:8844 \
        CREDHUB_CLIENT=ops_manager \
        CREDHUB_SECRET=example_secret \
        CREDHUB_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
        </pre>

#### <a id="deployments"></a>Identify Your Cluster Deployment Names

1. To identify your Kubernetes cluster deployment names, run:

    ```
    bosh deployments
    ```

    Kubernetes cluster deployment names begin with
    `service-instance_`. For example,
    `service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f`, where
    `ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f` is the cluster UUID you retrieved
    in [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify) above.

#### <a id="deployment-expiration-dates"></a>Determine Which Certificates Are Expiring

1. To review the expiration dates of the `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018`
CA certificates and their leaf certificates for a
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster:

    1. Run the following command:

        ```
        maestro list --expires-within TIME-PERIOD --deployment-name service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID
        ```

        Where:
        * `TIME-PERIOD` is the expiry window you want to filter.
        Valid units are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months,
        and `y` for years. For example, `1y` lists the certificates expiring within
        one year.
        * `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID you retrieved in
        [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify) above.

        For more information about how to check certificate expiration dates,
        see [maestro list](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-9/security/pcf-infrastructure/getting-started-with-maestro-cli.html#list)
        in the Ops Manager documentation.<br><br>

    1. Locate the `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates and
    their leaf certificates in the output of the `maestro list` command.

### <a id="rotate"></a>Rotate the Certificates

This section describes how to rotate the
`kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates and their leaf certificates
for a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster.
To rotate these certificates for multiple clusters,
repeat the procedure below for each cluster.

You can modify this procedure to rotate `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018`
separately, rather than at the same time.

To rotate the `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates and their leaf
certificates for a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned
Kubernetes cluster:

1. Regenerate the `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018` CA certificates:

 	```
    maestro regenerate ca --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro regenerate ca --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```

    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the cluster UUID. You retrieved the UUID in
    [Retrieve the Cluster UUID](#identify) above.
    <br><br>
    This step creates a new version of the CA certificates.

1. If you are running Ops Manager v2.10 or later, skip to the next step.
If you are running Ops Manager v2.9, mark the latest version of each CA certificate as transitional:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional latest --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro update-transitional latest --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```

1. Redeploy the cluster:

    1. Download the latest cluster deployment manifest:

        ```
        bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID manifest > PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
        ```

        Where `PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST` is the location where you want to save
        the cluster deployment manifest. For example, `/tmp/manifest.yml`.

    1. Deploy the cluster:

        ```
        bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID deploy PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
        ```

1. After the cluster redeployment completes
successfully, mark the signing version of each CA certificate as transitional:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional signing --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro update-transitional signing --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```

    This command also removes the transitional flag from the latest version of the
    CA certificates.

1. Regenerate all leaf certificates signed by `kubo_ca_2018` and `etcd_ca_2018`:

    ```
    maestro regenerate leaf --signed-by /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro regenerate leaf --signed-by /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```

1. Redeploy the cluster:

    ```
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID manifest > PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID deploy PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    ```

1. After the cluster redeployment completes
successfully, remove the transitional flag:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional remove --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/etcd_ca_2018
    maestro update-transitional remove --name /p-bosh/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID/kubo_ca_2018
    ```

1. Redeploy the cluster:

    ```
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID manifest > PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID deploy PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST
    ```

## <a id="unique-nsxt"></a>Rotate Cluster-Specific NSX-T Certificates

To rotate the unique NSX-T certificates used by a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster and register them with the NSX Manager, see [Certificate Rotation for TKGI](nsxt-certs-rotate.html).

## <a id="shared"></a>Rotate Shared Cluster Certificates

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> rotates shared cluster certificates automatically with selected tile upgrades.
Most of these certificates have four- or five-year expiry periods,
so users do not ordinarily need to rotate them.

After a shared certificate is rotated, all clusters must be updated.
If the certificate is also used by the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane,
the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane must be redeployed as well.

Certificate-specific notes:

- `kubo_odb_ca_2018`: Shared by Kubernetes clusters and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane.
If rotation is needed, contact Support.
