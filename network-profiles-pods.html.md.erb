This topic describes how to define network profiles for pod networks.

##<a name='custom-pods'></a> Custom Pod Networks

When you configure your NSX-T infrastructure for <%= vars.product_short %>, you must create a **Pods IP Block**.
For more information, see the [Plan IP Blocks](nsxt-prepare-env.html#plan-ip-blocks) section of _Planning, Preparing, and Configuring NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>_.

By default, this subnet is non-routable. When a Kubernetes cluster is deployed, each pod receives an IP address from the **Pods IP Block** you created. Because the pod IP addresses are non-routable, NSX-T creates a SNAT rule on the Tier-0 router to allow network egress from the pods. This configuration is shown in the diagram below:

  <img src="images/nsxt/non-routable-pods.png" alt="Non-routable pod network with SNAT">

You can use a network profile to override the global **Pods IP Block** that you specify in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile with a custom IP block. To use a custom pods network, do the following after you deploy <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Define a custom IP block in NSX-T. 
For more information, see [Creating NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>](nsxt-create-objects.html).  

2. Define a network profile that references the custom pods IP block.  
<br>
    For example, the following network profile defines non-routable pod addresses from two IP blocks:

    ```
    {
        "description": "Example network profile with 2 non-routable pod networks",
        "name": "non-routable-pod",
        "parameters": {
          "pod_ip_block_ids": [
            "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee55",
            "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee56"
          ]
        }
    }
    ```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use the same Pod IP Block ID (UUID) that is specified in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile. Create a new Pod IP Block ID (UUID) that is not referenced in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile and use it to define a network profile.</p>

##<a id='pod-prefix'></a> Pod Subnet Prefix

Each time a Kubernetes namespace is created, a subnet from the pods IP block is allocated. The default size of the subnet carved from this block for such purposes is /24. For more information, see the [Pods IP Block](nsxt-prepare-env.html#pods-ip-block) section of _Planning, Preparing, and Configuring NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>_.

You can define a Network Profile using the `pod_subnet_prefix` parameter to customize the size of the pod subnet reserved for namespaces.  

For example, the following network profile specifies /27 for the size of the two custom Pod IP Block IDs:

```
{
	"description": "Example network profile with 2 non-routable pod networks and custom prefix",
	"name": "non-routable-pod",
	"parameters": {
		"pod_subnet_prefix": 27,
		"pod_ip_block_ids": [
			"ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee55",
			"ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee56"
		]
	}
}
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot customize the size of the Pod IP Block ID (UUID) that is specified in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile. To customize the size of the Pod subnet block you must create a new Pod IP Block ID (UUID) that is not referenced in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile and use it to define a network profile. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The subnet size for a Pods IP Block must be consistent across all Network Profiles.
<%= vars.product_short %> does not support variable subnet sizes for a given IP Block.</p>

##<a id='routable-pods'></a> Routable Pod Networks

Using a network profile, you can assign routable IP addresses from a dedicated routable IP block to pods in your Kubernetes cluster. When a cluster is deployed using that network profile, the routable IP block overrides the default non-routable IP block described created for deploying <%= vars.product_short %>. When you deploy a Kubernetes cluster using that network profile, each pod receives a routable IP address. This configuration is shown in the diagram below. If you use routable pods, the SNAT rule is not created.

  <img src="images/nsxt/routable-pods.png" alt="Routable pod network using network profiles">

To use routable pods, do the following after you deploy <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Define a routable IP block in NSX-T. For more information, see [Creating NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>](nsxt-create-objects.html).

2. Define a network profile that references the routable IP block.  
<br>
    For example, the following network profile defines routable pod addresses from two IP blocks:

    ```
    {
        "description": "Example network profile with 2 routable pod networks and custom prefix",
        "name": "small-routable-pod",
        "parameters": {
          "pod_routable": true,
	      "pod_subnet_prefix": 27,     
          "pod_ip_block_ids": [
            "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee55",
            "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee56"
          ]
        }
    }
    ```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use the same Pod IP Block ID (UUID) that is specified in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile. Create a new Pod IP Block ID (UUID) that is not referenced in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile and use it to define a network profile.</p>

##<a id='pods-ips-add'></a> Adding Pod IPs 

If a cluster exhausts the number of IP addresses allocated to pods, 
you can use the network profile `pod_ip_block_ids` field to add pod IP addresses to existing clusters. 


To add pod IP addresses to the network profile `pod_ip_block_ids` field on an existing cluster:

1. Create one or more new Pod IP Blocks in NSX-T Manager.
1. Define a new network profile configuration file. 
1. Enter the default or original Pod IP Block as the first ID in the `pod_ip_block_ids` field followed by the new Pod IP Block(s).  
<br>
    For example, the following network profile configuration file has two `pod_ip_block_ids`, the first is the original IP block used when creating the cluster, and the second is the new IP block to use for pods. 

    ```
    {
        "description": "Example network profile for adding pod IP addresses to an existing cluster",
        "name": "pod-ips-add",
        "parameters": {
          "pod_ip_block_ids": [
            "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee55",
            "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee56"
          ]
        }
    }
    ```

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot change a cluster's network profile to remove pod IP block IDs.</p>

1. To assign the network profile to the existing cluster, run the following command:

    ```
    tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --network-profile NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the unique name of your cluster.
    * `NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the network profile you want to use for your cluster.

    On update the cluster will automatically start using IPs from the second block once those from the first block are exhausted.
